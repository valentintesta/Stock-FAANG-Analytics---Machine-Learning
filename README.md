# üìà Stock FAANG Data App - Machine Learning
This project is an interactive web application that allows users to visualize and predict stock closing prices for FAANG companies (Google, Apple, Microsoft, GameStop). It is built using Python, Streamlit, Yahoo Finance, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib.

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Downloading Financial Data
- The app uses yfinance to fetch historical stock data from 2015 to the present.
- The user can select a stock (GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, or GME) for visualization.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Stock Price Prediction: Comparing Predictions vs. Actual Prices

- Data from the last 100 days is used to make predictions.

- Test data is formatted into input sequences for the neural network.

- Predictions are generated and inverse-transformed to match the original scale.

- A comparison graph is created to visualize actual stock prices vs. predicted prices.
